# Secure Login Application

This application provides a secure login system with two-factor authentication (2FA) using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password). It was honored with the **First Prize** at Techxpression â€“ the hackathon organized by the Department of IT & CS at **B.K. Birla College, Kalyan**.

## Features

- User registration
- User login
- User logout
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using TOTP
- Session management
- Trusted locations
- Usual login times
- Dark mode

## Achievement

This project was awarded the **First Prize** in the hackathon at Techxpression, hosted by the Department of IT & CS at B.K. Birla College, Kalyan. The event showcased innovative solutions and technological excellence, with the theme AI & CyberSecurity.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/guest3301/secure-login.git
    cd secure-login
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Setup

1. During registration, a unique OTP secret is generated for each user.
2. Use an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Authy) to scan the QR code or manually enter the OTP secret.
3. During login, the user must provide the OTP generated by the authenticator app along with their username and password.

## Biometric Authentication

_TODO:_ The application supports biometric authentication for enhanced security. Users can enable biometric authentication in their account settings. Once enabled, users will be prompted to authenticate using their biometric data (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition) during login.

## Trusted Locations

Users can specify trusted locations from which they frequently log in. If a login attempt is made from an unknown location, additional verification steps will be required to ensure the security of the account.

## Usual Login Times

Users can define their usual login times to add an extra layer of security. If a login attempt is made outside the specified time range, additional verification steps will be required.

## Dark Mode

The application includes a dark mode feature for a more comfortable user experience in low-light environments. Users can toggle between light and dark modes using the button provided in the user interface.

## User-Friendly Aspects

The application includes several user-friendly features to enhance the overall experience:

- **2FA Setup Modal**: A user-friendly modal guides users through the process of setting up two-factor authentication, including scanning the QR code, manually entering the OTP secret, and saving backup codes.
- **Backup Codes**: Users are provided with backup codes that can be used if they lose access to their authenticator device. These codes can be downloaded or copied for safekeeping.
- **Clear Instructions**: The application provides clear instructions and feedback messages to guide users through the registration, login, and 2FA setup processes.

## Running Tests

1. Ensure you have all dependencies installed.
2. Run the tests using the following command:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
